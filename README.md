# THDMNLO_FA
This is the project containing all the components that we used to generate 2HDM EW-NLO counter-terms and corresponding Feynman rules in the format of FeynArts model files. 

The original files are too mess. So here, I try to reorganize them in a form that is easy for reading and for further usage in other models if possible.
