# THDMNLO_FA
This is the project containing all the components that we used to generate 2HDM EW-NLO counter-terms and corresponding Feynman rules in the format of FeynArts model files. 

The original files are too messy and un-readable. So here, I try to reorganize them in a form that is easy for reading and for further usage in other models if possible. 

## To Do List
1. Output to FeynArts Model File Format 
1. Parallel Calculation in Mathematica
1. Encapsulation
1. As a plug-in for FR?
